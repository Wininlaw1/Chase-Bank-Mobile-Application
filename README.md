# Chase-Bank-Mobile-Application
*I DO NOT OWN THE COPY RIGHTS TO THIS COMPANY ONLY FOR PROJECT USE*





I have developed a prototype for a new banking application inspired by the Chase Bank mobile application. This project is entirely for showcasing my design and development skills, as I do not hold any copyrights associated with the company. The application focuses on delivering a personalized user experience and features a streamlined dashboard to simplify financial management.
My vision for this project diverges from the conventional, mundane design of typical banking applications. Instead, the aim is to create a more engaging and dynamic user experience that incorporates playful and innovative elements, making banking feel approachable and enjoyable.
